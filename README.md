# Code Your own Quiz (Python Game)


## How do I complete this project?


In this stage, you will use the Python programming language to build your own quiz.
You will use a fill-in-the blank style to create a quiz that can even be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary.

## *Project Specifications*


## Game Review


* **Game Basics:**

    * Game has 3 or more **levels** and each level contains 4 or more **blanks** to fill in.


* **Beginning the Game:**

    * Immediately after running the program, user is prompted to **select a difficulty level** from easy / medium / hard.

    * Once a level is selected, game displays a fill-in-the-blank and a **prompt to fill** in the first blank.


* **Game Play:**

    * When player guesses correctly, new prompt shows with correct answer in the previous blank and a new prompt for the next blank.

    * When player guesses incorrectly, they are prompted to try again.


## Code Review


* **Use of Variables:**

    * Code uses **variables** to avoid magic numbers.

    * Each variable name reflects the **purpose** of the value stored in it.

    * Once initiated, the purpose of each variable is **maintained** throughout the program.

    * No variables override **Python built-in values** (for example, `def`).


* **Use of Functions:**

    * Function parameters have **logical names** and are used in the body of the function.

    * Functions are used as tools to **automate tasks** which are likely to be repeated.

    * Functions produce the **appropriate output** (typically with a `return` statement) from the **appropriate input** (function parameters).

    * No functions are longer than 18 lines of code (does not include blank lines, comments, or function and variable definitions).


* **Appropriate Use of Data:**

    * The appropriate **data types** are used consistently (strings for text, lists for ordered data, nested lists as appropriate).


* **Appropriate Use of Coding Techniques:**

    * Student demonstrates coding techniques like **branching** and **loops** appropriately (i.e. to loop through a list, for element in list:; or to test whether something is in a list, if name in list_names:).

    * Your code uses **statements** like `if`, `then`, `else`, `while`, etc... appropriately.


* **Comments / Documentation:**

    * Each function includes a **comment** which explains the intended **behavior**, inputs, and outputs (if applicable).
